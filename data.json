{"text": ", and see "},
{"text": " for a different outlook)."},
{"text": "Both analyses rely on the movement in question being covert in at least a subset of cases, since there are languages where word order facts seem to indicate uncontroversially that the modal is syntactically below negation. Iatridou & Zeijlstra ("},

{"text": "Thinking of the literature on the scope of DPs, a question that arises in this context is whether the wide scope reading here needs to be derived by covert movement, or whether there are other non-movement mechanisms that might do a better job. It is now quite widely accepted that apparent wide scope interpretations for indefinites, including wh-in-situ, is not derived by covert movement, but rather in-situ scoping mechanisms such as choice functions ("},
{"text": "), at least in some cases (see e.g. "},
{"text": " on indefinites, "},
{"text": " on wh-in-situ). This position is strongly motivated by the fact that wide scope readings of indefinites seem to be free of the structural restrictions that normally inhibit movement of DPs, such as island constraints ("},

{"text": "Accounting for facts such as (3) with covert movement requires a total rethink of what we know about islands, while an alternative which uses in-situ mechanisms avoids this problem."},
{"text": "In this article we argue that the (apparent) wide scope with necessity modals is not determined by syntactic movement, but rather by in-situ scoping mechanisms. The argument is of a similar tenor to the argument for wide scope indefinites, except our dataset is a comparative one. We show that the wide scope readings of necessity modals are found in a wide range of clause structures across languages, and we see that the clause structure parameters that normally impact upon movement of heads and predicates do not impact upon modal scope. Attention to the details of the analyses reveals a number of difficulties in implementing the movements syntactically, seen most clearly in the case of Iatridou and Zeijlstra\u2019s well-developed head movement analysis. Along the way we discuss additional issues for deriving the correct interpretations for modals in various negative constructions, and we conclude that the broader body of facts weighs against a syntactic account. In concluding, we outline a recent in-situ account of the modal facts ("},
{"text": "), where wide scope interpretations are achieved by a type of semantic enrichment derived in a grammatical framework for scalar implicatures ("},
{"text": "; "},
{"text": "), which allows us to avoid the pitfalls of the syntactic accounts."},
{"text": "The starting point for Iatridou & Zeijlstra ("},
{"text": ") (henceforth I&Z) and Homer ("},
{"text": ") is the observation that root modals (i.e. non-epistemic modals) vary with respect to whether they scope above or below sentential negation, with some intriguing asymmetries between possibility and necessity modals. On the one hand, possibility modals always scope below negation; this is shown by (4) for English, but the same seems to hold across languages in general. On the other hand, necessity modals are a mixed bag: "},
{"text": " obligatorily scopes above negation, "},
{"text": " scopes below negation if it is present, and "},
{"text": " (in its non-inflecting, bare VP-selecting form) actually "},
{"text": " negation or some other similarly downward entailing operator to take scope over it."},
{"text": "I&Z show that similar facts hold across languages, where some necessity modals scope above negation (with examples from English, Greek, Dutch, Hindi) but all possibility modals, and other necessity modals, scope below."},
{"text": " The fact that possibility modals and some necessity modals always scope below negation suggests that root modals have a uniform clause-internal first-merge position below negation, a position that I&Z and Homer take, and that we will assume (see "},
{"text": " for arguments)."},
{"text": " The variation with necessity modals is then tied to essentially lexical properties of the individual modals. I&Z follow van der Wouden ("},
{"text": "; "},
{"text": ") by taking the negation-sensitivity of "},
{"text": "-type modals to indicate that they are negative polarity items, much like quantificational determiners such as "},
{"text": ". This position is supported by the fact that "},
{"text": " and its kin are licensed not just in the scope of negation, but in the same range of non-upward-entailing contexts that license NPI determiners, such as in the scope of "},
{"text": " and the complement of negative verbs like "},
{"text": " (see "},
{"text": " for many more environments, for "},
{"text": " and its equivalents in Dutch and German)."},
{"text": "If some necessity modals are NPIs, we might expect others to be positive polarity items (PPIs). I&Z and Homer argue that this expectation is met by modals that scope above negation, such as "},
{"text": ", which are generated below negation but cannot take scope there due to their polarity sensitivity, and therefore have to move above negation, where they can (following similar claims by "},
{"text": "). Just like with PPIs like "},
{"text": ", PPI-hood is taken to be a lexical property of these modals, and additional syntactic mechanisms are taken to be at play when the PPI manages to outscope negation. Support for the PPI analysis comes from the fact that "},
{"text": " can scope below negation in the same kind of circumstances where other PPIs can, i.e. when the anti-licensing effect of a local negation is neutralized. For example, if the clause containing the negation and the PPI is embedded in a downward entailing context, the environment of a PPI\u2019s base position is globally upward-entailing, and thus it is not anti-licensed and may scope in-situ below negation. We can observe this effect in the contrast between (7a) and (7b): in (7a), "},
{"text": " originates below negation, an anti-additive environment, where it is anti-licensed, forcing it to QR above negation. In contrast, in (7b), the same clause containing negation and "},
{"text": " is embedded under "},
{"text": ", a Strawson downward-entailing environment. Therefore, "},
{"text": " may stay in-situ, as its global (Strawson) upward-entailing environment does not anti-license it."},
{"text": "The same pattern is observed with root necessity modals, in that the modal generally scopes above negation, as in (8a), but may scope below it if embedded under an additional negative operator, as shown in (8b)."},
{"text": "I&Z and Homer show that the same pattern can be replicated for these modals for other types of PPI-like behaviour, such as the effects of shielding, contrastive focus and clause boundaries. I&Z and Homer establish the PPI-hood of modals like "},
{"text": " in a similar fashion, and both argue that they must undergo LF movement above negation to avoid ungrammaticality below it. However, their proposals differ in the nature of the movement of the modal."},
{"text": "I&Z argue that these modals undergo interpretable head movement, as follows. In English, "},
{"text": " precedes negation, and so I&Z follow Pollock ("},
{"text": ") and many others in assuming that it has undergone head movement from first-merge position below negation (call this ModP) to a higher head position, namely T."},
{"text": "It is this instance of head movement, they claim, that is responsible for allowing the PPI modal to scope above negation, and since it is scope-extending head movement, it cannot plausibly be analysed in terms of PF movement or any other such terms. The fact that other modals such as "},
{"text": " scope below negation even when they precede it is attributed to obligatory reconstruction of the raised modal. Thus I&Z propose that modals reconstruct obligatorily by default, unless it gives rise to semantic anomaly. The fact that "},
{"text": " can in fact scope below negation in the contexts described above is to be expected, since reconstruction would not lead to anomaly in these cases. In short, the polarity sensitivity pattern implicates two distinct scope positions for "},
{"text": ", and these can readily be understood as the head and the tail of the movement chain. This furnishes I&Z with an elegant argument in favor of semantically active head movement (cf. "},
{"text": ", "},
{"text": ")."},
{"text": "Homer, on the other hand, assumes that modals do not undergo LF movement by default. However, if a modal is a PPI and originates in a negative polarity environment, it will move to escape it. In contrast with I&Z, it does so by phrasal movement of the ModP. We come back to what such phrasal movement might entail, and the problems it raises, in section 4.3."},
{"text": "As a final point, we want to highlight the fact that wide scope necessity modals come in a variety of types. We first note that there is variation in the obligatoriness of apparent scope taking: some take obligatory wide scope with respect to negation (like English "},
{"text": " or French "},
{"text": "), some take optional wide scope (like French "},
{"text": ") \u2013 Homer ("},
{"text": ") argues that the second type is due to an ability of the PPI to locally satisfy its polarity requirements (and thus optionally remain under negation). This distinction is irrelevant to the point in our paper, since we argue against syntactic movement of modals for any wide scope behavior, whether obligatory or optional (and we may show examples of either type). Second, a more relevant distinction for our purposes is that some modals scope above negation more robustly than others. This has led some authors to consider purely semantic analyses of these modals\u2019 wide scope behavior, where the modal stays "},
{"text": " below negation. In particular, \u2018weak necessity modals\u2019, which include English "},
{"text": ", have the distinctive property that they obligatorily scope above sentential negation, even when that negation is extra-clausal, as shown in example (10a) (in a configuration known as \u2018cyclic neg-raising\u2019). This contrasts with "},
{"text": ", which scopes below extra-clausal negation, at least by default, as shown in (10b)."},
{"text": "In this configuration, it is more difficult to argue that the wide scope interpretation of "},
{"text": " is a result of movement, as it would entail crossing a clause boundary, which is not typical of other known head movement phenomena. I&Z largely ignore this data point, although they do discuss how "},
{"text": " and "},
{"text": " vary in their behavior elsewhere."},
{"text": " Homer ("},
{"text": "; "},
{"text": ") on the other hand accounts for it, and while he falls short of saying that "},
{"text": " doesn\u2019t ever move,"},
{"text": " he claims that in a sentence like (10a), "},
{"text": " stays in situ and achieves its wide scope semantically, derived from an excluded middle presupposition just like neg-raising predicates "},
{"text": " and "},
{"text": " do (following "},
{"text": "). The claim that "},
{"text": " is a semantic neg-raiser was also made earlier by Horn ("},
{"text": "; "},
{"text": "), where "},
{"text": " qualifies as \u2018mid-scalar\u2019, a property that Horn claims can be ascribed to all neg-raisers (which, crucially, does not apply to "},
{"text": ", an \u2018end-of-scale\u2019 item). We therefore acknowledge that weak necessity modals have been argued to belong to the natural class of semantic neg-raisers like "},
{"text": " and thus receive their wide scope interpretation via purely semantic means. This claim has not been made for strong necessity modals like "},
{"text": ", which have only received an analysis as PPIs undergoing movement, which explicitly sets them apart from weak necessity modals (a difference clearly noted by both Horn ("},
{"text": "; "},
{"text": ") and Homer ("},
{"text": "; "},
{"text": "))."},
{"text": "In this paper, we hope to convince that not only weak necessity modals, but also strong necessity modals do not undergo syntactic movement. Therefore, to make this point strongly, our arguments will be based on data from necessity modals which pattern like "},
{"text": " under negated "},
{"text": " in (10b). Each point we make against movement of modals of the "},
{"text": " type can also be made of modals of the "},
{"text": " type, but we ignore the latter, since such modals are already likely to achieve their wide scope interpretation through means other than movement."},
{"text": "If wide scope for strong necessity modals is determined by verb raising, either by syntactic head movement or some sort of VP remnant movement, then we should expect to see the availability of modal scope interacting with changes in clause structure which are known to interact with verb raising crosslinguistically. In this section, we see that this expectation is not met, as wide scope is available in a number of configurations where there is no independent evidence to believe that the modal verb has raised to a position above the modal, or that it would even be possible to do so. We consider three classes of configurations: (i) where negation is a preverbal particle in the clausal spine; (ii) where negation is encoded by some higher operator, in Spec,TP or higher; (iii) where the modal is embedded under another auxiliary."},
{"text": "The movement analysis of wide scope for modals is particularly well-suited to English, since there are good reasons to believe English modals are in a higher position than their base-generated position: they typically scope below negation, which is taken to be below T, but they show up in T, above negation. However when we look at a wider range of facts from other languages, we see that the position of sentential negation seems not to matter, as root necessity modals may take scope over negation from various positions. We review a number of different subcases here."},
{"text": "First, there are languages in which the modal verb seems to stay particularly low, such as Russian and Slovenian. In Russian, verbs do not seem to exhibit V-to-T movement, since the finite verb follows adverbs ("},
{"text": "\u00a0"},
{"text": "), and negation also precedes the verb. The root necessity modal "},
{"text": " still can scope over negation, even though it seems not to raise over it, as shown in (11)."},
{"text": " The same is true for Slovenian, given in (12), which also has preverbal negation and is claimed to lack V-to-T on the basis of adverb order facts ("},
{"text": ")."},
{"text": "Then, there are languages such as Norwegian and Swedish, in which negation is a phrasal adverb (see e.g. "},
{"text": ") and the finite verb precedes it in main clauses but follows it in embedded clauses, due to the clause type-dependence of V2. Norwegian has a necessity modal "},
{"text": " which translates as \u201cmust\u201d and which scopes over clausemate negation in main and embedded clauses, irrespective of its position."},
{"text": " We provide an embedded example involving a relative clause, since these strongly resist embedded V2."},
{"text": "It seems not to matter for the scope of the modal in Norwegian or Russian that the modal verb stays low."},
{"text": "There are also languages in which the verb does seem to raise and negation seems to be situated in a higher head position which still precedes the verb. Greek, which we saw in the introduction, is one such language, and Spanish and Italian are similar. These languages show independent evidence for V-to-T movement, since the finite verb precedes adverbs (see e.g. "},
{"text": "), but sentential negation is a preverbal negative marker. "},
{"text": "-type modals scope over this preverbal negative marker in these languages too."},
{"text": "We note that overt verb raising past negation is consistently impossible in these languages and their varieties, even though they allow verb raising to C in the absence of negation (see "},
{"text": " for extensive discussion)."},
{"text": "A somewhat different kind of high preverbal negation is to be found in the Celtic languages, such as Scottish Gaelic, in which sentential negation is expressed not with a clause-internal operator but instead with a complementizer which precedes the verb and all other material within the TP."},
{"text": " Although most modal expressions involve non-verbal predication in this language, it has a verbal deontic necessity item "},
{"text": " which translates as \u201cmust\u201d and which occurs in T like other lexical verbs. This modal\u2019s scope with respect to a higher negation is subject to variation: while most speakers only get a reading where the modal scopes below negation, for some speakers the modal scopes above negation."},
{"text": "The fact that the modal may take wide scope with respect to negation, at least for some speakers, is quite surprising in light of the fact that no other quantifiers may outscope negation; for instance, universal quantifiers, whether in the subject or object position, may only take narrow scope."},
{"text": "Comparable facts are to be found in other languages with high negation as well, such as Tongugbe Ewe."},
{"text": " Ewe has bipartite clausal negative which is composed of a preverbal negative particle "},
{"text": "- and a clause-final negative marker "},
{"text": " ("},
{"text": "). There are reasons to believe that the sentence-final component of negation is as high as the CP-layer: it is in complementary distribution with other overt complementizers, it obligatorily occurs to the right of TP-level adjuncts such as time adverbials, and negation obligatorily take scope over quantificational subjects, for instance universal quantifiers, which precede the preverbal component of the bipartite negation."},
{"text": "We conclude (as do "},
{"text": ") that the second part of this bipartite negative marking ought to as high as the CP-layer, and thus just as high as the negative complementizer in Scottish Gaelic."},
{"text": " At the very least, the semantic scope of the bipartite negation is high enough in the clause to scope over the subject, and so the situation is comparable to that which we saw with Scottish Gaelic (and also what we see with Russian, Italian, Greek and Spanish, as discussed in section 3.2 below). To come back to the interaction with modal scope: in Tongugbe Ewe, deontic necessity is encoded by a form of "},
{"text": " followed by a finite clausal complement, and this modal takes wide scope with respect to the matrix-level negation, as we see in (19)."},
{"text": "To summarize, we find that root necessity modals outscope negative heads that precede them in a wide range of languages, in a variety of structural configurations. This includes cases where the verb is particularly low, as in Russian and Norwegian, and where negation is particularly high, as in Scottish Gaelic and Ewe."},
{"text": "Zooming out and taking a broader typological view, we are not aware of any generalizations regarding the kinds of clause structures which are conducive to wide scope root necessity modals. The availability of such modals seems to be somewhat arbitrary: Russian and Slovenian have such modals, but Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian does not; standard Dutch has one, but northeastern Dutch does not (see I&Z p. 530 fn.3); some Scottish Gaelic speakers have one, but others do not. The syntax of sentential negation seems not to be a relevant conditioning factor, since modals can scope over higher and lower sentential negatives, whether they have head status (as with Russian, Greek and Scottish Gaelic) and ones which have phrasal adverb status (as with Norwegian). The availability of wide scope seems to be a lexical property of individual modals, and subject to lexical variation. This makes the tie between movement and the extension of a modal\u2019s scope look tenuous, in particular in light of the fact that negation, in particular head negation, typically blocks verb raising across languages ("},
{"text": ", "},
{"text": "). Cases such as English seem to show us that there is no absolute ban on raising verbs past negation, at least at PF, but it is clear that we would expect some interaction between the crosslinguistic syntax of negation and modal scope if their interaction was in fact syntactically determined."},
{"text": "In this section we present data that show that wide scope of the modal is available with a variety of negative operators which are in a position higher than sentential negation: negative quantifiers in preverbal position, high covert negative operators in negative concord languages, negative inversion constructions and negative coordinators."},
{"text": "First, consider negative subjects. Iatridou & Sichel ("},
{"text": ") show that NegDPs in subject positions interact scopally with root modals in exactly the same way as sentential negatives in English. Thus possibility and necessity modals "},
{"text": " scope below both subject NegDPs and -"},
{"text": ", while necessity modals "},
{"text": " and "},
{"text": " scope over them both ("},
{"text": " can also scope below, at least for some speakers, as reported in Iatridou & Zeijlstra ("},
{"text": ")"},
{"text": "). The same facts hold in a number of the languages with NegDPs and wide scope necessity modals, such as French,"},
{"text": " Norwegian, Dutch,"},
{"text": " where the wide scope of the necessity modal is available. The examples below illustrate this fact (a narrow scope interpretation also seems to be available in all languages)."},
{"text": "Iatridou and Sichel argue that these facts follow from an approach to NegDPs where the scope of their negative component is determined by the same syntactic element as sentential negation. We do not get into the details here, but they predict that the scope of NegDPs will always be identical to that of sentential negation, and so it accounts for their generalization straightforwardly, and without recourse to reconstructing semantically negative determiners (which they show to have numerous problems, arguing against "},
{"text": ")."},
{"text": "Our contention here is that it is not correct to say that NegDPs always have the same scope as sentential negation, as there are cases involving operators other than modal verbs where we see differences between the two negatives. Consider the case of "},
{"text": ", a \u2018high\u2019 adverb which is shown by Nilsen ("},
{"text": ") to be a PPI. In non-negative clauses, "},
{"text": " can occur before or after the finite auxiliary (after is typically preferred), but in negative clauses with -"},
{"text": " it can only occur before the sentential negation."},
{"text": "If NegDP subjects scoped in the same position as sentential negation, we would predict that "},
{"text": " should be possible in a pre-verbal position but following a NegDP. However this is not borne out, as (24a) shows, and the contrast with (24b) makes clear that there is no unexpected lexical incompatibility between negation and "},
{"text": ", and they can appear in the reverse order, with its corresponding semantic scope."},
{"text": " (24c) shows that the ungrammaticality of (24a) is not due to "},
{"text": " appearing after a quantifier."},
{"text": "Similar facts obtain in French with "},
{"text": ", with the difference that it always occurs after the finite verb."},
{"text": "These facts indicate that the negation of NegDPs is not identical to sentential negation, but rather is higher, presumably as high as the subject position. This result dovetails with proposals in Zeijlstra ("},
{"text": ") and Collins & Postal ("},
{"text": "), who argue for NegDPs as semantically negative elements which encode negative scope from the subject position, rather than non-negative indefinites with special licensing conditions."},
{"text": "Evidence for a high position of negation with subject negative DPs is found more transparently in non-strict negative concord languages, like Spanish and Italian. These languages allow a negative DP in a preverbal position without an accompanying overt sentential negative, as opposed to postverbal DPs which must co-occur with one. To account for this pattern, Zeijlstra ("},
{"text": ") and Penka ("},
{"text": ") argue that in such languages, postverbal NegDPs must be licensed by the overt sentential negation, but preverbal NegDPs can\u2019t because they are not c-commanded by it, so a covert negative operator is merged in a higher position to license them. We observe that the availability of wide scope of necessity modals is not affected by this higher merge position for semantic negation. Indeed it is available whether the subject NegDP is before the verb (without sentential negation, as in (26)) or after the verb (with sentential negation, as in (27))."},
{"text": "In strict negative concord languages, the sentential negation marker must co-occur with any negative DP, whether preverbal or postverbal. Zeijlstra ("},
{"text": ") captures this fact by saying that the semantic locus of negation in strict negative concord languages is always a covert operator in the left periphery. Indeed Zeijlstra ("},
{"text": ") shows that strict and non-strict negative concord languages differ with respect to the scope of overt sentential negation, where in strict negative concord languages, it obligatorily scopes over a wider range of quantifiers in subject position. Nevertheless, in these languages, wide scope of necessity modals is observed; we show examples again with preverbal NegDPs, as these are arguably the ones which most clearly have a high covert negation (although if Zeijlstra is right the argument extends to any negation-containing sentence in these languages). The following demonstrates this with data from Russian (28a), Greek (28b)"},
{"text": " and Ewe (28c)."},
{"text": "Thus, for all these NegDP configurations, if I&Z are right in accounting for the data in terms of covert movement, the relevant movement rule must be able to move the modals quite high, as high as the upper regions of the left periphery."},
{"text": "Another construction where negation takes high scope is negative inversion in English (see "},
{"text": "; "},
{"text": "; "},
{"text": "). The fact that negation takes particularly high scope in negative inversion is shown by the following examples. (29) demonstrates that the fronted negative operator licenses subject NPIs, and the triplet in (30) shows that "},
{"text": "-clauses may outscope sentential negation and NegDP subjects, but not fronted negative operators in negative inversion."},
{"text": "The high scope of negation in negative inversion is discussed in more detail in Potsdam ("},
{"text": "). Potsdam observes that quantificational arguments are actually unable to take scope over the negation of negative inversion constructions, on the basis of data such as (31). He also shows that the same holds for inverted negation in negative imperatives and negative questions, and concludes that inverted negation generally takes wide scope in CP or FocP."},
{"text": "However, as Francis ("},
{"text": ") notes, "},
{"text": " is surprisingly still able to scope above negation, in contrast with other scope-taking elements."},
{"text": "Therefore, if the modal undergoes head movement \u2013 specifically, some covert step of head movement to a higher position than its landing site after T-to-C movement \u2013 it must do so to a projection above the FocP or CP, depending on the analysis, and such a movement must be forbidden for phrasal categories such as "},
{"text": "-clauses, which must scope below negation in this construction."},
{"text": "Finally, consider negative connectives, i.e. "},
{"text": " and its equivalent in other languages. We observe that wide-scoping modals such as English "},
{"text": ", French "},
{"text": " can produce a wide scope interpretation when present in negative coordinations."},
{"text": "These facts are especially problematic for a movement account of the modal\u2019s wide scope. We show in particular that a widespread analysis of "},
{"text": " as a negative disjunction is strikingly incompatible with modal movement to derive its wide scope. To see this, consider how negative coordinations are analyzed. For two propositions "},
{"text": " and "},
{"text": ", the meaning of a negative coordination can be decomposed as one of two truth-conditionally equivalent possibilities: a conjunction of negative elements (\u00ac"},
{"text": ") \u2227 (\u00ac"},
{"text": "), or a negation of a disjunction \u00ac("},
{"text": " \u2228 "},
{"text": "). Most prominent analyses of negative coordinations involve a negated disjunction (Gonzalez ("},
{"text": ") for French, "},
{"text": " for BCS and "},
{"text": "; "},
{"text": " for Turkish). In such an analysis, for the modal to outscope negation, it must raise above the entire coordination, resulting in an LF of the type \u25a1\u00ac("},
{"text": " \u2228 "},
{"text": "). This LF, however, does not correspond to the intended reading, since the modal only applies to one of the disjuncts; there is no way of achieving the desired reading by any movement of the modal, whether it be head movement or something else. Otherwise, if negative coordinations were conjunctions, contra the claims in the above-cited papers, we would have to assume a final LF of the type (\u00ac"},
{"text": ") \u2227 (\u25a1\u00ac"},
{"text": "It has long been observed that native speakers have strong intuitions about \u201cpossible words\u201d in their language. For example, Halle ("},
{"text": "), which is in violation of the Law of Coordination of the Likes, and raises issues on how close does negation have to be to the conjunction to license the "},
{"text": " coordination. Note that the alternative approach presented in section 5, in contrast, naturally accounts for the wide scope interpretation of the modal in a negative coordination, regardless of its underlying semantics."},
{"text": "For all of the cases described in this section, deriving wide scope via head movement requires movement of the modal to some position above TP or higher. In all cases, this movement must be covert, since the negative operators are higher than the overt position of the modal. In the case of Negative Inversion, the modal\u2019s surface position is already a derived one, yet is expected to scope below negation, so the modal would have to undergo further covert movement above it. As for negative connectives, the wide scope interpretation is particularly problematic for a movement account, as it is logically incompatible with the common analysis of negative connectives as disjunctions; otherwise, under the already less popular conjunctive analysis of negative coordinations, a movement account of modal scope leads to adopting a number of shaky assumptions."},
{"text": "A question that does not arise with English "},
{"text": ", but which can be asked using data from other languages, is whether a "},
{"text": "-type root necessity modal may scope over a clausemate negation even if it is embedded under another auxiliary. In this section we show that modals in such configurations still scope over negation, even though the modal is c-commanded by another verbal head."},
{"text": "First, consider the case of French. In simple cases, French verbs move to T ("},
{"text": "). French has several necessity modals that can take scope above negation. In particular, "},
{"text": " takes obligatory wide scope, as shown in (34) (similar facts and arguments presented in this section hold for "},
{"text": ", that takes optional wide scope)."},
{"text": "Following an analysis of the I&Z type, the wide scope of "},
{"text": " is achieved by head movement of the modal to T, above the negation marker "},
{"text": " (though still below the second, optional negation marker "},
{"text": "). However, we show that these modals can also be used in constructions that clearly don\u2019t have movement to T, i.e. in infinitival constructions, as in (35a), and in compound tenses, as in (35c). Wide scope of the modal is still available in these cases, despite the lack of overt head movement."},
{"text": "The strong challenge here comes from (35b) and (35c),"},

However, they appear after adverbs when in their nonfinite forms, e.g. the near future, (36a), and conditional, (36b). As in French, these involve a finite verb in T which embeds the modal.

{"text": "), is that they are gradient in the sense that nonce words tend to form a cline of acceptability. For example, Scholes ("},
{"text": ") asked American seventh grade students to judge whether a series of nonce words were possible or impossible words of English; by aggregating the judgements across students, he discerned a cline of acceptability. In past work, some researchers have proposed that gradience reflects similarity to existing words, perhaps because the judgement task makes use of lexical search ("},

{"text": "How, then, can modals outscope negation in all of the different structures we have seen? In this section we present the head movement-based analysis of I&Z. Recall that in their discussion of Greek, I&Z suggest that the modal undergoes "},

{"text": "For languages in which NegP is above ModP but below TP, like Russian, the modal would need to covertly raise to TP, and the analysis would be much like what was schematized in (9) for English, except that the head movement in question is covert.

{"text": " In languages in which the verb raises past adverbs but not negation, like Greek, we assume that the NegP projection which hosts the overt negative head is above TP, following Zanuttini ("},
{"text": ")."},
{"text": "I&Z do not commit to a specific implementation of head movement, nor do they commit to details on the clause structures or phrase structures for negation involved. In what follows we flesh out some specific implementations, and assess the theoretical issues that arise when it comes to dealing with the data discussed above. First, we discuss implementations in terms of classical head movement, spelling out how this might work for two specific clause structure analyses. Second, we discuss how one might account for the scope facts in terms of the alternative approach to head movement in Matushansky ("},
{"text": "), where it is analysed as an instance of head-to-specifier movement. Finally, we discuss the phrasal movement account in Homer ("},
{"text": ")."},
{"text": "Let us first consider the case of classical head-to-head movement (for a recent defense see "},
{"text": "). We will consider two implementations with fairly conventional phrase structure: (i) the modal raises covertly over the NegP to some higher (semantically vacuous) head X, skipping the Neg head completely, as shown for finite modals in (41a); (ii) the semantically interpreted negation is a phrasal specifier of NegP and the modal moves through its semantically vacuous head to a higher (also vacuous) X position, as shown in (41b) for finite modals."},
{"text": "These diagrams involve the high NegP above TP, and so would be applicable to Spanish and Greek. For languages such Scottish Gaelic, negation would be in some higher C position immediately above the highest head in the inflectional layer (cf. "},
{"text": " on Irish), and there would need to be covert head movement to some X which would be a higher complementizer in the CP layer."},
{"text": "For both of the analyses above, we must assume some type of interpretable covert head movement of the modal. One immediate problem with this is that there is little to no empirical evidence for covert head movement independent of the proposal at hand. Covert head movement features prominently in early Minimalist work such as Chomsky ("},
{"text": "), but there was little in the way of empirical motivation for this component of the theory, and none of this was retained in subsequent developments of the framework (e.g. "},
{"text": "). Arguably, the burden of proof for covert head movement should be set particularly high, since there is as much demand for the elimination of covert movement as there is for the elimination of head movement (see e.g. "},
{"text": "; "},
{"text": "). Moreover the addition to the theory of technology such as Agree ("},
{"text": "), which does much of what covert movement did in early Minimalism,"},
{"text": " renders covert head movement suspiciously redundant. In addition, a related problem is that covert head movement of modals, so construed in line with I&Z\u2019s proposal, would be markedly different from QR of DPs, since DPs can often QR for no reason other than to take wide scope ("},
{"text": "), while covert head movement would only be permitted to rescue a polarity clash. Recall that the default for non-PPI modals is to scope below negation obligatorily, so allowing optional covert head movement of modals (without obligatory reconstruction) would lead to overgeneration. It\u2019s not clear why covert head movement would differ from covert phrasal movement in this way."},
{"text": "A related empirical problem comes directly from the case of Scottish Gaelic in particular. Recall from section 3.1 that sentential negation in Scottish Gaelic is encoded by a negative complementizer, and that in at least some varieties the root necessity modal may scope over this negative element. The analyses above would necessitate an analysis where the modal moves covertly to some position above this negative complementizer. The trouble with this is that this instance of covert movement would need to be unique in the language, as other quantifiers are not able to scope over sentential negation, as shown in the sentences in (17), where universal quantifiers in subject and object positions scope below negation, even though QR is otherwise available (for object>subject scope). Similar facts are found in Ewe, as shown in (18), which also has a particularly high syntactic negation."},
{"text": "These facts are arguably part of a more general pattern, discussed in section 3.2, whereby negation in the CP-domain obligatorily takes scope over QPs in the clause that the C embeds ("},
{"text": "). Accounting for data in I&Z\u2019s terms would require us to say that covert head movement is able to target some position above the CP-negation, but covert phrasal movement is not. This is a further step in the direction of a disunified analysis of quantificational scope-taking, and it is not clear what it would derive from."},
{"text": "An additional problem for the structures in (41a)\u2013(41b) is that they involve multiple violations of the Head Movement Constraint ("},
{"text": "). First, consider the structure in (41a): the HMC is violated in this structure because the modal crosses Neg without adjoining to it. It is shown by Zanuttini ("},
{"text": ") and Zeijlstra ("},
{"text": ") that negation of the Greek/Italian type is a head in the clausal spine; in this respect, it is different from the negation of languages such as Norwegian, which behaves like a phrasal category (i.e. an adverb) with respect to a number of other independent diagnostics. One of the head-like properties that negation shows in these languages is that it blocks (overt) verb raising to C, for instance in questions or imperatives where the verb would normally raise in the absence of negation (see especially "},
{"text": " on these issues). Such facts are expected in the context of the HMC. Given the analysis of Greek/Italian negation as a head, and the fact that verbs (including modal verbs) do not move overtly past negation in any case in these languages, the claim that the modal moves over covertly on an analysis such as (41a) is somewhat surprising."},
{"text": "The analysis in (41b) avoids the HMC problem that troubles (41a), but does so at the cost of an empirically unsuccessful account of the syntax of negation, since it involves analysing the overt negative element as a phrasal specifier. As noted above, Zanuttini ("},
{"text": ") and Zeijlstra ("},
{"text": ") provide a number of empirical arguments for analysing the overt negators in Greek/Italian type languages as heads, distinguishing them from the adverb-like negatives of languages such as Norwegian and Dutch. These properties would need to be reconsidered one-by-one if we were to adopt the analysis in (41b). In addition, Zeijlstra ("},
{"text": "; "},
{"text": ") argues that the availability of negative concord across languages can be accounted for, and indeed explained, on the basis of the division of languages into head negation vs non-head negation languages (i.e. Italian vs Dutch). By adopting the analysis in (41b), we would have to give up on this as well, since it would effectively collapse this distinction."},
{"text": "The HMC problems only multiply once we consider the specifics of the embedded modal cases discussed in section 3.3. In all cases, the modal occurs in some low position below negations of different kinds (high negation in Spanish, most likely low negation in the others), and so in order for these modals to scope over negation they must be undergoing covert head movement to some higher head position above the NegP projections. (42)shows how this might work for French, where T is occupied by an auxiliary such as "},
{"text": ", which has moved from some lower position where it embeds a constituent containing the modal (which we represent as ModP here)."},
{"text": " Spanish would be broadly similar."},

A second way to model the same fact within a gradient grammar is to consider phonotactic statements about possible sequences within the grammar as being attached to probabilities (again, reflecting actual frequency of occurrence of structural factors in real words), and the grammar would assign lower probabilities to words where the structural factors within them have lower probabilities."},
{"text": "While one can obviously see the merits of such a strategy, we would like to raise awareness here that the approach of "},
{"text": " modelling gradient acceptability judgements as stemming from gradient generalisations within a grammar presupposes that a substantial portion of (if not all) the observed gradience in acceptability judgements stems from the grammar. As we will argue in this paper, this presupposition is incorrect."},
{"text": "Despite the dominance of gradient phonotactic knowledge or lexical similarity as the basis of gradient wordlikeness judgements in current thinking, there are likely many other interacting factors that affect such judgements. Indeed, linguists and psychologists have long recognised that all linguistic performance is a complex, multifactorial phenomenon ("},
{"text": "; "},
{"text": "; "},
{"text": "; "},
{"text": "). Therefore, we should be exploring how these factors affect acceptability judgements in tandem with the proposed grammar. Note, our larger point is not that such gradient models are inadequate to account for the observed acceptabilities (some of them, such as the Hayes & Wilson ("},
{"text": ") UCLA Phonotactic Learner, are often very powerful weighted grammars and can sometimes fit observed data extremely well) \u2014 it is more that such complex models might be unnecessary to account for the observed gradience, "},
{"text": ". Therefore, such gradient grammatical models, while sometimes effective in accounting for observed data, might not be an accurate reflection of the underlying computations made by human beings."},

{"text": ", those which are often unfaithfully perceived and perceptually \u201crepaired\u201d? Two possibilities suggest themselves: either (a) acceptability judgements are made before the perceptual repair, making them independent of the repair, or (b) the acceptability judgement is made after perceptual repair, making them contingent upon the post-repair percept(s). These two possibilities are schematised in (1). The second possibility would pose serious problems for the study of phonotactic knowledge via wordlikeness judgements, as such judgements would be based on a representation that has already been \u201crepaired\u201d by phonological knowledge to conform to the patterns in the language, "},
{"text": ", as per the second possibility, the grammar affects the actual percept itself, so it is not quite clear why a judgement would involve the use of the grammar "},

{"text": "Consistent with the view (in 1b), we will argue that wordlikeness judgements are in fact based on perceived (and \u201crepaired\u201d) representations."},
{"text": "Furthermore, the issue of non-veridical (and gradient) perception is even present with the perception of "},
{"text": " of nonce words. For instance, the classic Miller & Nicely ("},
{"text": ") study shows that there is a lot of variability in responses of licit monosyllabic C\u0251 nonce words (even in the high signal-noise ratio condition), with some CV sequences showing far more variable identification than others. Therefore, there is a gradience in perception that is not equitably distributed across all sequences. However, typical word-acceptability modelling proceeds with the modelling assumption that the acceptability judgement is over a percept that is identical to the input stimulus, and that there is no bias or variance introduced by the perceptual system. Consequently, such models that implement gradient phonotactic knowledge attempt to account for the observed gradience purely through the grammar. In contrast to this assumption, we will argue that at least some of the gradience observed in such judgements stems from gradience in the perceptual system."},

A similar cluster of problems besets the analyses for the data from Spanish, French and English, and adopting a version of the analysis in (41b), where the modal raises through negation, would not improve matters, since the modal would still need to cross both the higher auxiliary\u2019s trace and its derived position where it is adjoined to T. Stepping back from the technicalities for a moment, it seems fair to say that the kind of head movement that is required to derive (42) would be quite unlike anything else that is familiar from the overt syntax of these languages. Its status is suspicious at best."},
{"text": "A potential way out in the case of the embedded modal data is to confront the HMC head-on ("},
{"text": "), in light of cases in other languages where it seems not to apply. One class of cases which is particularly relevant is the so-called "},
{"text": " (LHM) construction, where we see a participle moving over a local auxiliary to some higher position in the same clause (see e.g. "},
{"text": "; "},
{"text": "). LHM is found in southern and western Slavic, Balkan languages and in Old Romance, and it is illustrated for Bulgarian in the following example, in which the participle occurs to the left of the auxiliary."},
{"text": "A possible analysis of the embedded modal facts is to say that the covert syntax of these modals is the same as the overt syntax of LHM, with the only difference being in patterns of pronunciation."},
{"text": "While this line of reasoning is familiar, and in principle capable of accounting for some of the data, it is still limited, since LHM is much more restricted than whatever mechanisms are involved in providing embedded modals with wide scope. One restriction on LHM is that it only applies in finite matrix clauses, much like V2 movement in Germanic ("},
{"text": "). If wide scope for modals was derived by LHM, then we would incorrectly predict no wide scope in the French example (35a), in which the modal occurs in a non-finite embedded subject clause, as well as English (39). The insensitivity of the availability of these modals\u2019 wide scope to clause structure, unexpected if derived by movement, echoes the more general cross-linguistic and cross-structural pattern we uncovered in the previous section. A second restriction that often applies to LHM, which is particularly relevant here, is that it is often blocked by negation. Rivero ("},
{"text": ") discusses this at length and shows that in languages such as Bulgarian, LHM is impossible in negative clauses."},
{"text": "This restriction does not apply to all LHM languages however, as Slovak differs from Bulgarian in allowing LHM in negative clauses if the negative marker attaches to the fronted participle."},
{"text": "Rivero shows that the possibility of LHM in negative clauses correlates with the type of negation, such that it is impossible in languages with \u2018high\u2019 negation (where NegP occurs above TP, "},
{"text": ", "},
{"text": ") but possible in languages with \u2018low\u2019 negation (\u2018English-type\u2019 languages, according to Rivero). These are the kinds of interactions between negation and head movement that we might expect to find, but we did not find any such interactions in our overview of wide-scoping modals in the previous section, and so this makes LHM and modal scope seem quite distinct. In particular, it is hard to see how invoking covert LHM would derive wide scope for the embedded modals in Spanish, given that it is a \u2018high\u2019 negation language. We conclude, then, that invoking LHM of the Slavic/Balkan type is unlikely to provide us with a means by which to understand the ability of embedded modals to scope over clausemate negatives, and so the problems outlined above still stand."},
{"text": "Of course, it is possible to draw another, perhaps more nihilistic conclusion from the LHM phenomenon, namely, that the HMC is not a real restriction on syntax at all, and that any argument for or against specific analyses of head positions that is built on the HMC is doomed from the start. This would strip our argument in this section of much of its potency, and so we should acknowledge it. But any move in that direction would leave unaccounted for a great number of restrictions on rules that affect heads, and it would ultimately constitute an abandonment of much of the empirical base of syntactic theories of head movement, thus making it look decidedly less syntactic. This doesn\u2019t seem to be a productive move for defenders of syntactic head movement to make."},
{"text": "Finally, one could consider the possibility that only "},
{"text": " head movement is subject to the HMC, while covert movement is not so restricted. This strikes us as undesirable, for at least two reasons. First, if anything we would expect the covert version of head movement to be the more restricted one, given that covert phrasal movement seems to be more restricted than overt phrasal movement. Second, if we assume that there is no postsyntactic LF-movement but rather that covert operations simply involve pronouncing the lower copy of a movement chain, as is quite typical in contemporary work (see e.g. "},
{"text": "), then this proposal would suggest that the HMC is not syntactic in nature, but rather it would be a PF-phenomenon. But if this is the case, then the case for a syntactic analysis of head movement would be weakened significantly, only lending support to non-syntactic alternatives."},
{"text": "In summary, the data reviewed in section 3 is difficult to account for in terms of an account where modal scope is determined by classical head movement. Simply put, if the scope of modals is determined by syntax, then it should interact with syntax in a meaningful way. This is not what we see crosslinguistically."},
{"text": "Although our primary target in this paper is classical head movement of the head-head adjunction type, another implementation of head movement to discuss is the one in Matushansky ("},
{"text": "). Matushansky\u2019s proposal is intended to solve the various theoretical problems with classical head movement that were raised by Chomsky ("},
{"text": "). Although it has proven somewhat influential in certain areas of the literature (see e.g. "},
{"text": ", "},
{"text": ", "},
{"text": "; "},
{"text": "), as far as we know it has not been subjected to many detailed critiques."},
{"text": "The starting point for Matushansky\u2019s article is the list of problems identified by Chomsky ("},

Second, in the context of Chomsky\u2019s probe-goal framework, there is the question of how one can force a probe to attract just a head X and not the XP that it heads; this seems to require introducing some diacritic for distinguishing heads and phrases, an unwelcome move in the context of Chomsky\u2019s theory. We can call this the Attraction Problem. Third, Chomsky lists a bunch of other properties of head movement which seem to distinguish it from phrasal movement and which, for Chomsky, render head movement\u2019s theoretical status particularly suspect."},
{"text": "These problems are also discussed insightfully by Roberts ("},
{"text": ") and D\u00e9k\u00e1ny ("},

{"text": " ("},
{"text": "). On this analysis, which is situated in the Distributed Morphology framework ("},
{"text": "), the syntax derives structures such as (47a), where X moves to the specifier of an immediately dominating YP, and then when the structure is spelled out, here conceived as shipping the structure from syntax to a distinct morphological component, the m-merger rule readjusts the terminals to produce the structure in (47b), where X and Y form a complex head which will feed Vocabulary Insertion."},
{"text": "This analysis immediately solves the c-command problem and the countercyclicity problem, and it captures the \u201csnowballing\u201d property of head movement (it passes through and picks up all other heads on its way to its final landing site) by positing that spellout and thus m-merger apply at every maximal projection. As for the Attraction Problem, Matushansky analyses head movement as being driven by an uninterpretable c-selection feature on the attracting head, X above, and it attracts just the head of the lower projection YP because this is the minimal element that it can attract and satisfy the attractor\u2019s requirements. Matushansky argues that phrasal movement is simply an instance of pied-piping, which applies when moving only the head is unavailable, and she claims that this holds whenever the attracting X and the attracted Y are not in an immediately local relation, due to a condition which she calls the Transparence Condition (p. 48):"},
{"text": "This predicts that head movement and phrasal movement should always be in complementary distribution, and it predicts that head movement will always be strictly local, as required by the HMC. Note finally that Matushansky\u2019s approach requires that every maximal projection be a phase, since m-merger is cast as a morphological operation which applies after every step of head movement, and so every maximal projection will need to be sent to spellout in order to ensure that m-merger applies to every step of head movement."},
{"text": "How could Matushansky\u2019s account be used to account for the modal scope data? Matushansky does not discuss covert head movement in her paper. The desired outcome is one where Matushansky-style head movement may apply freely and unconstrained by locality when it is covert. Syntactic and morphological restrictions conspire to derive the locality of head movement in this account \u2013 in particular, the combination of the c-selection trigger and the obligatory application of m-merger in each maximal projection \u2013 so it makes sense to look to the morphological component of this analysis as a means by which to set covert head movement free, since covert movement ought not to feed morphological operations."},
{"text": "The analysis does not predict that head movement should be completely free, because the Transparence Condition ensures that pied-piping will occur in any case where a probe attempts to attract a head X when it is contained in its XP. However, if the head X is first extracted covertly to the specifier of the immediately dominating YP, and m-merger fails to apply, then that X should be visible to any attracting head above. Thus in (49), if Z or B bear a [uX] probe (which is not necessarily a c-selection feature) then they should be able to attract X, unconstrained by the Transparence Condition, since X has been extracted from XP and thus its accessibility is not at stake."},
{"text": " But given that every phrase is a phase on this account, movement to BP would need to proceed via ZP, since B could only find elements at the edge of the ZP phase."},
{"text": "Thus to derive long-distance head movement of X to Spec,BP, there would need to be three features implicated: a c-selectional feature that attracts X from within XP, an \u201cedge\u201d feature which attracts X to a non-terminal landing site, and a feature which attracts X to its (criterial) scope position. Although it is somewhat baroque, a derivation of this kind ought to get the desired result: moving modals covertly would be free of HMC restrictions. Thus the difficult case of Spanish embedded modals could be derived from a (simplified) structure such as (50), where the modal moves covertly via all available specifier positions all the way to Spec,XP, a position above the high NegP projection."},

Pairs such as (51)\u2013(52) demonstrate this: while (51) allows for a reading where the subject scopes below the adverb "},

{"text": "It is vital for Matushansky that m-merger applies to the moved head X and its host Y prior to merge of a next-higher head A, because if that doesn\u2019t happen, A will only attract Y (the head it c-selects) and X will not be pied-piped with it, deriving something akin to excorporation. What this means is that spellout must make X-Y into a syntactically opaque complex head prior to any further syntactic operations applying, and so m-merger/spellout must feed syntax. This requires an \u201cinterleaving\u201d of cycles of syntax and morphology which seems to be in direct violation of basic principles of modularity (see "},
{"text": " for critical discussion). In addition, it is not clear what kind of theory of phases is assumed to make this work. In the derivation of (53) the YP must have been spelled out prior to A merging. But it is widely assumed that when a domain is spelled out, its internal content cannot be affected by any subsequent syntactic operations (see e.g. "},
{"text": "); in the words of Uriagereka (1999), the spelled-out domain is \u201clike a giant lexical compound\u201d (p. 256). How can the internal contents of that domain be accessible to A? And even if the domain can somehow remain accessible and A can trigger copying of Y into Spec,AP, how can some subpart of that domain, the lower copy of Y, then be deleted following movement, if it has already been spelled out as part of the YP domain? There is a deep conflict here, one which seems to require a total rethink of how phases and spellout work. The combination of this problem, the modularity issue and the empirical problems with the every-phrase-is-a-phase outlook seems to us to be reason enough to reject the Matushansky approach to head movement."},
{"text": "This outlook also creates problems for the analysis of modals in particular. Recall that the outlook defended in I&Z was one where head movement of a modal would only be semantically non-vacuous if it had an effect on interpretation, for instance if it was to take a PPI-modal out of the scope of a c-commanding negation. This was necessary to capture the fact that non-PPI root modals typically scoped below negation unambiguously, across many languages. The claim in I&Z\u2019s analysis was that any instance of modal head movement which did not have such an effect on movement would obligatorily undergo total reconstruction; we can understand this as involving deletion of the interpretable features of the higher copy which would feed semantic interpretation, subject to economy considerations (cf. "},
{"text": "). But given the every-phrase-is-a-phase model, deriving a structure such as (50) would require multiple instances of modal movement which would have no effect on the interpretation of the PPI modal, and which would obligatorily reconstruct going by I&Z\u2019s reasoning. Thus reconstructing the first step of movement from XP to Spec,YP would result in the head copy X failing to bear any of the semantic features which would be responsible for deriving semantically non-vacuous movement, and so any subsequent operation that targets and copies that X will also be semantically vacuous. It is not clear, then, how successive-cyclic head movement could be semantically non-vacuous in this system if it did not have an effect on interpretation at each cycle (as is required for covert phrasal movement by "},

For Homer, the ModP undergoes phrasal movement to a position above negation, if and only if it is ungrammatical below negation.

In these sentences, the only apparent possibility for this intensional operator is the necessity modal "},

In (63), the statement holds of the (near) future, which can also be analyzed intensionally.

To conclude this article, we would like to take some time to outline a recent in-situ account of the modal scope facts which we think ought to provide a plausible alternative that we are in need of, for at least a subset of the cases of wide scope necessity modals.

While it does give a natural explanation for the obligatory non-specific reading of the existential when the modal takes wide scope in (75), it cannot say anything about the reading observed in (77): first, a modal whose domain has a bound variable cannot move above the quantifier binding that variable; second, that quantifier has a specific reading, which indicates wide scope above the modal, again incompatible with movement of the modal above the negated existential."},
{"text": "Finally, as pointed out in section 3.2, some English speakers allow for narrow scope of the modal with NegDPs. We attribute the availability of this narrow scope reading to a particular property of the projection of alternatives adopted in Jereti\u010d ("},

Therefore, the basic makeup of the LF is similar to the negative existential cases presented above. We do not go into the details of the analysis of these constructions, but it is reasonable to assume that they can have the same properties that license the wide scope interpretations in the cases observed with NegDPs, namely a) scope splitting of the negative existential on either side of the modal, or b) a meaning of `must' that is anchored to a time variable (or whichever variable is involved in a negative inversion licensing adverbial). Syntactically, negation in these constructions is taken to be in the FocP or CP, a higher position than the typical sentential negation position.

Instead, a number of additional tenuous assumptions would have to be taken to account for the data in such languages, namely covert head movement, and movement to a high, unclear position that would violate the HMC, and a movement that differs in its properties from overt head movement and QR. These problems multiplied when we considered a wider range of configurations for the wide-scoping modals, such as nonfinite and participial embedding contexts and contexts where the negative operator is particularly high."},

Furthermore, our results indicate that directly modelling acceptability judgements with a (gradient) grammar will necessarily, and incorrectly, incorporate the gradience from non-grammatical sources into the grammar. In fact, just observing gradience in acceptability judgements tells us nothing about the underlying grammar. For example, any categorical system that has a sufficiently noisy implementation will look gradient on the surface. Therefore, the shape of the response patterns by themselves should therefore not be taken as any indication of the underlying state of the grammar; instead, studies like the current one are necessary to compare patterns of judgement with patterns of non-grammatical processes in order to understand how to factor out the different sources present in an acceptability judgement. More generally, our results go hand-in-hand with those of Sch\u00fctze ("},

Furthermore, while we believe the use of such a constrained stimulus set was essential as a first step in order to carefully understand the underlying sources of the gradient acceptabilities based on established prior perceptual results, we do think there needs to be more such work done on much larger sets of stimuli in order to establish the main point beyond reproach. Therefore, the results presented herein should be taken as a proof of concept, and we encourage other researchers interested in modelling/testing acceptability judgements to include perceptual experiments as part of their experimental procedure."},
{"text": "One approach that might initially be considered reasonable to avoid the confound of probabilistic perceptual representations is the use of orthographic presentations. Orthographic presentations are sometimes seen as directly informing the participant of the representation to be judged ("},

{"text": ")\u2014"},
{"text": ", knowledge of spelling rules\u2014rather than purely phonotactic knowledge to make such judgements. In fact, Daland et al. ("},
{"text": ") acknowledge the possibility of orthotactic knowledge influencing the judgement of nonce words, but argue that it is likely to only explain a \u201ccoarse difference in rating between attested, marginal and unattested onsets\u201d, and not any gradient judgements of unobserved clusters. However, such a view presupposes that orthotactic knowledge is purely based on segment-like letters, and that speakers have no awareness that letters form classes with similar patterns akin to natural classes in phonology. Using orthographic presentation further assumes that there isn\u2019t much gradience in inferring a phonemic representation from orthographic representations, contrary to fact ("},
{"text": "). We think orthographic presentation requires much more careful scrutiny before it can be used as a surrogate for auditory presentation, and one needs to incorporate more explicit theories of orthotactic knowledge into modelling judgements based on orthographic presentation. We would like to note that we believe this is a rich line of enquiry for those interested in using orthographic presentations to understand the nature of phonotactic knowledge."},
{"text": "Our results also raise the following questions: (a) What exactly do gradient phonotactic models of wordlikeness judgements capture? Note, perception itself uses phonological knowledge; therefore, perceived representations have already been in some sense \u201cfiltered\u201d by the phonotactic grammar. Consequently, any judgements based on such repaired perceptual representations and any gradience observed in such judgements would not be an accurate reflection of the listeners phonotactic knowledge. This we believe is a genuine issue for researchers interested in using statistical modelling of such judgements to claim an underlying gradient phonotactic grammar, and raise it here to encourage future scrutiny. (b) To what extent are phonotactic perceptual repairs versus wordlikeness judgements perhaps comparable to ultimate parses versus (sometimes temporary) illusions of (un)grammaticality that have been discovered for sentence-level comprehension and judgements ("},

If wordlikeness judgements are based on probabilistic perceived representations, as discussed in the paper, and reflect some sort of weighted average rating over such probabilistic percepts, it is easy to envision how a substantial amount of gradience observed in such judgements actually stems from perceptual gradience even in cases beyond illusory vowels. Crucially, variable or probabilistic percepts are true even in the case of segments (or segment sequences) observed in the language, as is known since the classic work of Miller & Nicely ("},
{"text": "). Their study shows that there is a lot of variability in responses even in the case of licit monosyllabic C\u0251 nonce words (even in the high signal-noise ratio condition), with some CV sequences showing far more variable identification than others. For example, they observed that [\u03b8] is often asymmetrically confused with [f] at extremely high rates (a phenomenon that is well-known today). So, a real word like <thick> [\u03b8Ik] might sometimes be perceived as the nonceword [fIk]. Note, the Ganong effect ("},
{"text": "; "},
{"text": ") may bias the listener towards the real word <thick>, but it doesn\u2019t completely exclude the possibility of interpreting the input as the nonceword [fIk]. Consequently, the probabilistic perceived representation will include some nonceword possibilities, which will thereby decrease the overall acceptability judgement of the word."},
{"text": " In contrast, a segment such as [t"},

{"text": " with other segments; therefore, a word such as <tick> [t"},
{"text": "Ik] is likely to have a lower probability of illicit nonceword percepts \u2014 this in turn would suggest a higher rate of acceptability than the first case. We now have a situation where the words and the segmental sequences are both observed and perfectly grammatical, yet we have an expectation of gradience in acceptability judgements. In a similar vein, one could show that less frequent phonotatic sequences trigger higher rates of confusion, and therefore are more likely to be judged as less acceptable, than more frequent phonotactic sequences."},

Pronouns, for example, provide little descriptive content and are therefore often ambiguous as to their intended referents. Determining the referent that the speaker intended for a pronoun can therefore be a challenging task. Ambiguity can be avoided by the use of definite descriptions, but at the cost of greater syntactic and lexical complexity. Many languages \u2013 although not English \u2013 provide an alternative to definite descriptions: Anaphoric d(emonstrative)-pronouns, which are structurally as simple as the more common p(ersonal)-pronouns.

Thus, p-pronouns and d-pronouns often provide means to reduce the ambiguity problem that arises with a single pronoun only. In addition to the antecedent\u2019s grammatical function, its linear position and its discourse status affect the resolution of ambiguous pronouns, as shown by a large body of research (e.g., "},

This finds a parallel in the interpretive preferences discussed above insofar as a pronoun following the same contexts is preferentially interpreted as coreferent with the stimulus argument independently of whether the stimulus is realized as subject or object.

{"text": "The clausal analysis was introduced by Aoun & Benmamoun & Sportiche ("},

This is illustrated in (8); FCA is out when the sentence contains the collective predicate \u2018meet\u2019 (8a). Only resolved agreement is possible here (8b). Aoun & Benmamoun & Sportiche\u2019s account is that a number sensitive item can only be used when the sentence contains a plural subject. A clausal coordination structure contains two clauses with singular subjects, and therefore number sensitive items cannot be used, resulting in the ungrammaticality of (8a). Instead, a coordination of nouns must be used (which behaves like a plural subject), and this gives rise to resolved agreement (8b)."},
{"text": "The clausal analysis of verbal FCA has been criticised on several points. Munn ("},
{"text": ") provides a number of counterexamples to the observation that number sensitive items cannot be used in clauses with FCA, showing that these elements might not be a good diagnostic for coordination level (see however Aoun & Benmamoun & Sportiche ("},
{"text": ") for a critical evaluation of Munn\u2019s examples). Moreover, Munn shows that the verb can show FCA even if the first conjunct binds a pronoun in the second conjunct, see (9)."},
{"text": "Since this binding relation between the conjuncts requires that the first conjunct c-commands the second conjunct, the only possible structure for (9) involves a coordination of nouns.

{"text": "In conclusion, Munn ("},
{"text": ") shows us that nominal coordination has to be underlying to at least some examples of FCA. However, this does not mean that we should completely rule out the clausal analysis of FCA; clausal coordination may still be the correct analysis for sentences with FCA that do not involve, for example, binding between the first and second conjunct. Furthermore, the expectation is that an underlyingly clausal coordination receives a different interpretation than a nominal coordination because it contains two separate clauses. Specifically, a sentence with clausal coordination should be preferentially interpreted as distributive or expressing two events (cf. "},

J\u00e4rvikivi et al.\u2019s results suggest that semantic and structural biases play different roles in pronoun resolution: Whereas the former pull p- and d-pronouns in the same direction, the latter have complementary effects on p- and d-pronouns.

Second, the interpretation of the d-pronoun was also affected by the coherence relation, but the preference did not switch, being always in agreement with the purported object orientation of d-pronouns. The object preference of the d-pronoun was almost absolute when the stimulus object was favored semantically by a cause relation.

{"text": "An alternative account is provided by theories postulating a close connection between pronoun interpretation and pronoun production. Instead of a principled difference between p- and d-pronouns, the particular properties of the contexts investigated by Portele & Bader ("},

{"text": ") second experiment, which presented participants with the same contexts as shown in (5) followed by a no-pronoun prompt, that is, a blank line. The results of this second experiment showed a strong semantic bias induced by a cause relation, as evidenced by over 80% continuations with the stimulus referent taken up again. With a consequence relation, as expected the experiencer argument was the referent that was mentioned most often, but the preference was weak, reaching 46% of all cases. The stimulus was mentioned next in 30%, and the remaining continuations either contained no reference to experiencer or stimulus at all, or a joint reference to both of them. Since the experiencer was the subject in the materials of Portele & Bader ("},
{"text": "), the semantic bias of the consequence relation toward the experiencer subject may have been too weak to overcome the d-pronoun\u2019s structural bias toward the object referent. An additional finding of this experiment was that p-pronouns were used more often for referring to the subject than to the object, but objects were referred to with a p-pronoun in still 10% of all cases. D-pronouns, in contrast, were used rarely, and they always referred to the object and never to the subject. This would be compatible both with a relatively strict anti-topic constraint for d-pronouns and with a strong object orientation of d-pronouns (see discussion in "},
{"text": "). However, since the subject was maximally prominent and the object maximally non-prominent in these materials, this finding is also compatible with a more gradient preference of d-pronouns referring to less prominent referents.

{"text": "In sum, the finding that the coherence manipulation applied by Portele & Bader ("},

Due to this change, neither of the two referents of the third context sentence is strongly favored by structural biases, as shown by the boxes above each referent in (7c).

The risk that effects of semantic biases are masked by structural biases is therefore lowered."},

{"text": "In order to have participants produce continuations standing in either a cause or consequence relation, a question asking for a reason or a consequence was inserted between the final context sentence and the prompt, as illustrated in (8) (see "},

The authors found that pronominalization rates were higher for the more likely stimulus referent compared to the experiencer, but this finding was limited to object referents.

Due to this difference and the mixed results for implicit causality contexts, we remain agnostic as to whether pronominalization rates will be influenced by the likelihood of reference. If semantic biases in terms of likelihood of reference influence pronoun production, we should find an interaction between coherence relation and referent for the production of pronouns in Experiment 1. In causal contexts, the stimulus is most expected in the continuation, which should result in a higher pronoun rate for stimuli than for experiencers, whereas the likelihood of being re-mentioned is higher for experiencers in consequential contexts, resulting in the prediction of more pronouns used for experiencers than stimuli."},

{"text": ". In conclusion, the analysis based on nominal and clausal coordination derives the 3-out-of-4 pattern of Polish verbal and complementiser agreement."},
{"text": "Citko ("},
{"text": ") provides an alternative analysis of the Polish verbal and complementiser agreement data. Citko assumes that the coordination is always nominal, and that the outcome of agreement is the result of two different types of Agree: Singular Agree and Multiple Agree. Without going into the details, Singular Agree leads to agreement with the closest conjunct, and Multiple Agree leads to resolved agreement. The two variants of Agree are in (essentially) free variation. When both the complementiser and the verb undergo Multiple Agree, they both express resolved agreement. When the verb undergoes Multiple Agree, but the complementiser undergoes Singular Agree, the verb expresses resolved agreement and the complementiser FCA. When both the verb and the complementiser undergo Singular Agree, they both express closest conjunct agreement. However, the fourth logical combination, in which the complementiser undergoes Multiple Agree, and the verb undergoes Singular Agree, leads to the pattern that is not attested in Polish: resolved agreement on the complementiser but last conjunct agreement on the verb. Citko provides some speculation on why this combination is excluded: she suggests that Singular Agree is less economical than Multiple Agree, and that principles of economy exclude a more economical operation on a higher Probe to follow a less economical operation on a lower Probe. This is not satisfactory. For example, if this economy requirement were true, we would need to rethink why a language like German allows C to trigger "},
{"text": "-movement (arguably not economical) when T does not trigger movement at all (arguably economical). In contrast, the analysis proposed in this paper only makes use of independently motivated properties of agreement, coordination, and Right Node Raising. Furthermore, as mentioned in footnote 10, there are languages in which resolved agreement on a higher agreeing element and closest conjunct agreement on a lower agreeing element do cooccur, such as Sason Arabic ("},
{"text": ") and Jordanian Arabic ("},
{"text": "). Al Khalaf provides an analysis of the Jordanian Arabic data by adopting and modifying Citko\u2019s ("},
{"text": ") approach to closest conjunct agreement. Crucially for our purposes, Al Khalaf\u2019s analysis does not require a ban on Multiple Agree on the higher agreeing element, and Singular Agree on the lower agreeing element. Since Jordanian Arabic provides empirical evidence against stipulating such a ban, there is no reason to think that it would apply in Polish. We can conclude that Citko\u2019s analysis may be underlying to closest conjunct agreement in some languages (such as Jordanian Arabic), but that it is not the right analysis for Polish, because it overgenerates."},
{"text": "An increasingly popular approach to closest conjunct agreement is that it is the result of feature copying at PF, based on linear order. In this section, I discuss this alternative approach, and show that it cannot account for the Frisian and Polish data."},
{"text": "The linearity approach to closest conjunct agreement is argued for by Benmamoun & Bhatia & Polinsky ("},

{"text": "); Maru\u0161i\u010d & Nevins & Badecker ("},
{"text": "); Maru\u0161i\u010d & Nevins ("},

{"text": ")\u2019s terminology, identifies the target of Agree. This step takes place in syntax, and is restricted by the usual conditions on Agree (e.g. c-command). The second step of Agree is feature copying or valuation: Agree-Copy. Importantly, Agree-Copy can take place at different times with respect to operations in syntax and at PF. If Agree-Copy happens in syntax, it copies the features of the whole coordination, resulting in resolved agreement (cf. "},
{"text": "). If Agree-Copy happens in PF after linearisation, it will copy the features of the linearly closest element to the agreement target. This will be spelled out as closest conjunct agreement. The crucial aspect of this proposal is that it places closest conjunct agreement at PF."},
{"text": "The Frisian and Polish data are problematic for this approach to FCA. Starting with Frisian, we have seen that FCCA is optional, and, importantly, has an effect on interpretation. The interpretative effect of FCCA clearly shows that it cannot be located at PF, as whatever happens at PF is independent of semantic interpretation. Instead, FCCA in Frisian must be syntactic, because its effects are visible both in semantics and at PF."},
{"text": "The linearity approach to FCA also cannot account for the interaction between FCCA and verbal last conjunct agreement in Polish. As shown in the previous section, both the complementiser and the verb can agree with the closest conjunct in Polish, but there is a gap: the verb cannot show last conjunct agreement if the complementiser expresses resolved agreement. This gap is hard to account for if closest conjunct agreement is located at PF; there is no clear reason why closest conjunct agreement on the verb is blocked in the context of resolved agreement on the complementiser. In fact, the reverse is allowed: the complementiser can show FCA when the verb shows resolved agreement. Apart from stipulating it, the linearity analysis does not have much to say about this restriction. On the other hand, the previous section showed that it falls out straightforwardly by adopting clausal coordination as the underlying structure of the sentence."},
{"text": "In short, while some cases of closest conjunct agreement might be based on linearity, it is clear that FCCA in Frisian and Polish are not, and that the approach based on two-step Agree does not work for these varieties. The Frisian and Polish facts can be accounted for when we assume that both nominal and clausal coordination are possible derivations of FCCA."},

It is possible that singular agreement in Tegelen Dutch is a case of interference from Standard Dutch, and that the grammar of Tegelen Dutch resolves agreement on verbs that have RNR\u2019ed as plural agreement (for an extensive discussion and examples of the effect of Dutch on a minority language in the Netherlands (Frisian), see Bergstra ("},

Independent support for the clausal analysis of coordination comes from Tegelen Dutch, where the coordinator can agree with the second conjunct. Following van Koppen & Cremers ("},
{"text": ")\u2019s analysis of coordinator agreement as resulting from clausal coordination, I showed that coordinator agreement has similar properties as FCCA.

This distinction is relevant when we want to investigate, for instance, which factors determine if a language allows an agreement target to agree with the first conjunct of a nominal coordination. I argued that in Frisian (and Tegelen Dutch), this configuration is not possible, even though superficially it looks like it is. We thus need to consider what the underlying structure of a coordination is, to make sure we only include languages where FCA with a nominal coordination is allowed."},

In other words, when a coordination (say, of nouns) can be parsed as either a coordination of nouns, or as a larger coordination where everything except for those nouns undergoes deletion or movement, then the coordination of nouns should be preferred. However, this paper shows that a clausal parse of superficial N&N coordination is possible, at least when this parse can be morphosyntactically differentiated from the nominal coordination parse (by FCCA or last conjunct agreement on the verb)."},

The preference toward the first-mentioned stimulus subject in the presence of a cause relation was equally strong for p- and d-pronouns, and the same holds for the preference toward the second-mentioned experiencer object in the presence of a consequence relation. We hypothesize that the lack of a difference between p- and d-pronouns in Experiment 3 is due to the fact that we constructed contexts in such a way that neither the stimulus subject nor the experiencer object was strongly favored on structural grounds. In such a situation, semantic biases may take full control over how pronouns are interpreted. J\u00e4rvikivi et al., in contrast, used one-sentence contexts in which the subject was probably understood as topic by default, so all structural biases favored the subject NP as antecedent of the p-pronoun and the object NP as antecedent of the d-pronoun."},

We postpone a more thorough discussion of these results to the general discussion because of a possible objection against Experiment 3. In accordance with prior research on implicit causality and pronoun resolution, we found a strong preference for the stimulus subject when the prompt contained a causal discourse marker. For the p-pronoun, this preference aligns with the structural bias of p-pronouns toward subject antecedents. For the d-pronoun, in contrast, the observed preference for stimulus subjects contradicts the often-found object bias of d-pronouns. Due to the experimental set-up, participants were required to write a continuation for sentences starting with a d-pronoun in contexts that exerted a strong semantic pressure to associate the d-pronoun with a subject antecedent. It is therefore possible that participants wrote continuations in which the d-pronoun referred to the stimulus subject although such continuations were not fully acceptable to them and they would not have used a d-pronoun if they were free to choose a referential expression. In order to exclude this possibility, we ran a further experiment investigating the acceptability of selected continuations from Experiment 3."},
{"text": "Experiment 4 investigates whether participants in Experiment 3 produced acceptable continuations. Maybe participants in Experiment 3 established reference of a d-pronoun towards the structurally dispreferred subject due to the combination of a strong semantic subject bias and a d-pronoun in the continuation prompt, therefore forcing them to interpret a d-pronoun as referring to a subject referent. In order to address this issue, we had a new group of participants rate the acceptability of a selection of original continuations from Experiment 3. All continuations were selected in a way that the pronoun referred to the referent favored by the coherence relation, that is, the stimulus subject with a causal relation and the experiencer object with a consequence relation. As in Experiments 2 and 3, the coherence relation was explicitly signaled by either "},

{"text": "If reference to the stimulus subject by means of a d-pronoun is an artifact of the particular way Experiment 3 was set up, the acceptability ratings of the continuations produced in this experiment are expected to show an interaction between pronoun and coherence. With a consequence relation, the d-pronoun\u2019s structural bias and the semantic bias converge on the experiencer object. Acceptability ratings should accordingly be high for d-pronouns with a consequence relation. With a cause relation, the d-pronoun\u2019s structural bias still favors the experiencer object but the semantic bias now favors the stimulus subject. Thus, when the d-pronoun is interpreted as coreferential with the stimulus subject, the continuation makes sense but acceptability should go down because this interpretation is in conflict with the d-pronoun\u2019s structural object orientation. If, on the other hand, the d-pronoun is interpreted as coreferential with the object, the structural constraint is met but the continuation is implausible because it attributes causality to the experiencer instead of the stimulus. This should thus result in reduced acceptability. For continuations given to p-pronoun prompts, in contrast, either the reverse is expected in virtue of the p-pronoun\u2019s subject orientation, or no difference at all is expected because the interpretation of p-pronouns is more flexible than that of d-pronouns."},

However, topichood still seems to have affected pronoun choice in Experiments 1 and 2, as witnessed by the finding that the pronoun rate was only slightly higher for subjects (=non-topic) than for objects (=topic), in contrast to experiments where subjecthood and topichood are aligned and pronoun rates for subject/topic antecedents are much larger than those for object/non-topic antecedents (for German, see "},
{"text": "). Our results therefore argue in favor of a weakened Topichood Hypothesis, with subjecthood being an additional factor influencing pronoun production. Given that Zhan et al. ("},
{"text": ")\u2019s experiments on Chinese applied a similar manipulation as Rohde & Kehler ("},
{"text": ") but did not find a corresponding effect of topichood, it is likely that subjecthood and topichood have different weights in different languages."},
{"text": "As for the production of demonstratives, only tentative conclusions are possible because they were produced rarely in Experiments 1 and 2. In Experiment 1, the highest number of demonstratives occurred for stimulus subjects in cause relations (n = 19). This finding argues against the claim that demonstratives are mainly used for referents bearing the grammatical function of object. Since the object was always the topic of the previous sentence in our experiments, references to the subject are in accordance with the anti-topic bias of demonstratives. On the other hand, demonstratives were also produced for making reference to the object and thus the non-topic. In sum, our results for demonstratives argue against approaches capitalizing on a single factor (e.g., syntactic function, see "},
{"text": ") and instead for a multifactorial approach as proposed in Bader & Portele ("},
{"text": ")."},
{"text": "With regard to semantic bias due to coherence, the interpretive preferences observed in Experiment 3 are in close correspondence with the next-mention preferences found in Experiment 1. More specifically, the results presented in this paper provide supportive evidence for the Bayesian Theory of Pronoun Resolution proposed by Kehler and colleagues according to which next-mention biases and pronominalization biases make independent contributions to pronoun resolution. The fit between observed and predicted values found for Experiment 3 was close for both p- and d-pronouns, showing that the Bayesian Theory accounts for d-pronouns as well. A similar close fit was found by Bader & Portele ("},
{"text": ") in the first application of the Bayesian Theory to p- and d-pronouns in German, but there semantic biases were rather weak so structural factors had to bear the burden of resolving the referential ambiguity. Taken together, the results presented here and the results presented in Bader & Portele ("},
{"text": ") show that the Bayesian Theory accounts for the interpretation of German p- and d-pronouns under widely different combinations of structural and semantic biases (see also "},
{"text": ", and "},
{"text": ")."},
{"text": "The finding that semantic bias can cause d-pronouns to have the same interpretative preferences as p-pronouns argues against the often made claim that p-pronouns preferentially refer to prominent referents whereas d-pronouns are confined to make reference to referents that are least prominent. According to this claim, a referent that is the preferred target of a p-pronoun must be prominent. If so, such a referent should repel reference by a d-pronoun. This is clearly not the pattern that we observed for the coherence manipulation in Experiment 3. The referent that was highly expected due to the combined effect of verb semantics and coherence relation, and thus can be considered prominent, was the preferred antecedent of both the p- and the d-pronoun. As shown by prior work, when neither referent is (strongly) favored on semantic grounds, p- and d-pronouns typically show complementary behavior, but even then identical preferences may arise for the two pronouns under certain structural configurations. A configuration of this kind is provided by object-before-subject sentences, as first shown by Kaiser & Trueswell ("},
{"text": ") for Finnish and later replicated for German by Bader & Portele ("},
{"text": "). Because p-pronouns are biased toward the subject referent whereas d-pronouns are biased toward the final referent, the same referent is preferred when the subject is the final NP in a sentence. Restricting the notion of prominence to structural factors would thus not rescue the hypothesis that p-pronouns go for prominent and d-pronouns for non-prominent antecedents."},
{"text": "In sum, the results presented in this paper add to the growing body of evidence suggesting that, instead of identifying different prominence factors influencing the interpretation of different types of pronouns, the perspective taken by research on pronoun resolution should shift to production biases. The success of the Bayesian Theory testifies to the fruitfulness of this perspective. For example, since p(referent), the term of the Bayesian formula that is (mainly) governed by semantic biases, is independent of the particular pronoun under consideration, it follows immediately that coherence affected p- and d-pronouns in the same way in Experiment 3. With regard to the second term of the Bayesian formula, P(pronoun|referent), we see a close link between the Bayesian theory of Kehler et al. ("},
{"text": ") and the form-specific approach of Kaiser & Trueswell ("},
{"text": "). We think that these approaches complement each other. With the term P(pronoun|referent), the Bayesian theory provides the means to capture pronoun-specific preferences. Since P(pronoun|referent) captures the probability that a speaker uses a pronoun for a given referent, pronoun-specific interpretation preferences are the result of different production biases associated with particular pronouns according to the Bayesian theory. Under this perspective, additional research into the production of p- and d-pronouns will be crucial for understanding why these two pronoun types show different interpretive preferences."},

{"text": "In a nutshell, the proposal is the following: Verum focus is focus on sentence mood. There is a projection in the lower section of the left periphery dedicated to sentence moods that is labeled MoodP. Focus on mood is represented by a focus feature on the mood feature. The superficial differences in the expression of verum in the three languages result from independent parametric differences that condition verb movement. In German declaratives, the finite verb reaches MoodP, so the focus feature is expressed directly as stress on the verb. In English, the lexical verb remains in VP. The sentence mood feature is inherited by TP where an auxiliary is stressed. In Spanish, neither finite lexical nor auxiliary verbs reach the left peripheral MoodP in a declarative, nor is the feature inherited by TP, therefore the particle "},

{"text": " and "},
{"text": ". The two terms are often used interchangeably as they are closely related concepts. However, while clause types are grammatically defined classes of sentences (declarative, imperative, interrogative), sentence moods (also declarative, imperative, interrogative), according to Portner ("},
{"text": "), tell us how clause types are used to perform conversational functions. Clause type and sentence mood often coincide, for instance in English there are three clause types and three sentence moods. In languages that have a more finely grained mood distinction, this is however not the case (see for instance "},
{"text": "; "},
{"text": "). Therefore, clause type and sentence mood cannot always be identified with one another."},
{"text": "The clause type of the embedded sentence in (19-a) is interrogative, but its subjunctive verbal mood means that it cannot be used as a root sentence to ask a question. This means it does not have an interrogative sentence mood because it cannot perform the conversational function of an interrogative. In other words, (19-a) does not add "},
{"text": " to the top of the stack of questions under discussion. Although an interlocutor might answer the embedded question ("},
{"text": "., "},
{"text": ".), they cannot use the simple answer particles ("},
{"text": "/"},
{"text": ") in this context. A felicitous context, however, would also be one where the interlocutor does not answer the embedded question at all ("},
{"text": ".; "},
{"text": "). The clause type of the main sentence in (19-b) is interrogative because it has the grammatical properties of an Italian polar question expressed through word order and intonation. Contrary to the embedded sentence in (19-a), it also has the sentence mood of an interrogative because it can perform the dedicated conversational function of asking a question. It is added to the stack of questions under discussion and a cooperative interlocutor will do their best to resolve the question by answering it."},
{"text": "The approach to verum focus that is adopted here differs from most others proposed in the literature in that it does not assume that there is a verum operator responsible for the interpretation. Gutzmann ("},

The accounts furthermore differ in their assumptions about the presence of the operator. In the focus accent thesis a verum operator is present in every sentence. The verum meaning arises when this operator is focused. In the lexical operator thesis, not every sentence contains a verum operator. The operator is only present when verum is realized. In the sentence mood theory verum is a result of focus on a sentence mood feature. The feature is present in every sentence, however, it does not have a dedicated verum meaning. The verum effect is a by-product. Finally, the accounts differ in their empirical base. While the focus accent and lexical operator theses draw their evidence from verum in declaratives, the sentence mood theory of verum focus has the advantage of broader empirical coverage. Cases of verum in interrogatives, imperatives and embedded contexts are mentioned in H\u00f6hle ("},
{"text": ") and Gutzmann et al. ("},
{"text": "), but neither of them can straightforwardly explain the pragmatic effect of verum in non-declarative sentences, nor do they account for the syntactic restrictions of verum focus in different clause types and in embedded contexts.

{"text": "Although I argue in favor of the sentence mood theory of verum focus, I want to emphasize again that I maintain that focus on sentence mood might be only one way to achieve a verum effect. In principle, the different conceptions of verum I sketched above can co-exist and can each be best equipped to account for a subset of empirical phenomena. See also Gutzmann et al. ("},

{"text": "For my account, I adopt Lohnstein\u2019s core assumptions: I thus consider verum meaning to result from focus on sentence mood and focus, in the sense of Krifka ("},

{"text": " In my revised version of the theory, the functions of the sentence moods are different from the original version. Lohnstein\u2019s theory is built on a mental conception of commitments.

My revision thus constitutes a reformulation of the functions as commitments in this sense. By revising the theory in this way, it is not only brought in accordance with the newest insights from research on speech acts, it also solves an issue of overgeneralization the original theory faces: According to Lohnstein ("},
{"text": "), the function of a declarative is to express a belief. Thus, the relevant alternatives that are focused are "},

{"text": ". A problem that follows from this definition is that it wrongly predicts that a verum focused declarative is felicitous in a context where whether or not the interlocutors believe "},

The speaker who utters the polar question is not in a position to judge whether the proposition expressed is true or false.

The effect of verum in this context is that speaker C presses speakers A and B to justify their commitment. Speaker C would not be satisfied if speakers A and B merely restated their commitments without further justification. In fact, by using verum focus, speaker C calls them out to take up the responsibility to defend "},

{"text": "The licensing of verum in a final settling of a questions can also be explained. The verum effect in declaratives, in the present theory, results from stressing the comittment to "},

{"text": "The sentence mood theory of verum focus functions as a conceptual backdrop to the syntactic analyses that I develop in the following sections.

In accordance with Lohnstein ("},

{"text": "; "},
{"text": "; "},
{"text": "). While the line of research concerned with the syntactic representation of pragmatics is certainly interesting, it has also met criticism (cf. for instance "},

{"text": " cannot be at odds with the dismissal that THROW communicates, as we saw in example (3)."},
{"text": "It is worth pointing out that a "},
{"text": " realization of THROW, where the gesture is synchronous with the accompanying utterance, can be hard to distinguish from a "},
{"text": " (or "},
{"text": ") realization where THROW precedes the accompanying utterance. These realizations are most easily distinguished in examples where the accompanying speech has a prosodic peak near the end of the sentence, as in (7). Here, a pro-speech THROW will be realized before "},
{"text": ", as indicated in (7B"},
{"text": "), whereas the stroke of a co-speech THROW will be aligned with the word containing the nuclear accent, "},
{"text": ", as in (7B"},
{"text": ") (see, e.g., "},
{"text": "). The two realizations appear to have identical effects in (7B"},
{"text": "\u2013B"},
{"text": ")."},
{"text": "Going forward, when we probe for the semantic contribution of THROW, the most conservative approach is to look at THROW without an accompanying utterance, as the presence of an accompanying utterance will often trigger additional inferences. For instance, in (5B"},
{"text": "), we infer that B\u2019s dismissal is justified by the accompanying assertion that "},
{"text": ", which suggests that it does not matter if it gets late on a Saturday night. By contrast, in (5B"},
{"text": "), we infer that B\u2019s dismissal is justified by the accompanying assertion that "},
{"text": ", which suggests that 3am does not count as late. These inferences are not contributed by THROW, nor does THROW operate on them in any meaningful way. They simply coalesce with the THROW contribution in the pragmatics. The inclusion of an accompanying "},
{"text": " utterance thus introduces a confound into an investigation of THROW proper. In Sections 2.3 and 2.5, we only consider uses of THROW without an accompanying utterance; in Section 2.4, we revisit predictions on the "},
{"text": " interplay, and we return to "},
{"text": " in Section 2.6."},
{"text": "We began with the informal intuition that THROW comments on something that has been said in the preceding discourse. There are in principle several ways to cash out this idea formally: we could say that THROW targets i) a proposition, ii) a question, or iii) a speech act. In (4), we have chosen option (ii), for the following reasons."},
{"text": "One reason to model THROW as commenting on a question (Q) rather than a proposition (p) is that THROW is not restricted to contexts where the previous discourse move was a (proposition-denoting) declarative, or makes a unique proposition salient; it can equally well respond to interrogatives denoting non-biased questions (i.e., sets of propositions). Taking THROW to evaluate the question addressed by a preceding utterance allows us to capture both kinds of cases in a uniform way. To see this, consider the following two contexts, (8) and (9), in which Q amounts to a polar question ("},
{"text": "). If "},
{"text": " is a declarative with unmarked sentential stress, as in (8A"},

{"text": "}, as indicated in (9B). In (8) and (9), "},
{"text": " is the utterance that immediately precedes the THROW utterance, but we will also see examples where this is not the case (specifically, example (30) in Section 2.6)."},
{"text": "By commenting on the question {"},
{"text": ", \u00ac"},
{"text": "} addressed by a declarative "},
{"text": ", as in (8), THROW indirectly comments on the proposition "},
{"text": " contributed by "},
{"text": "). I take a more cautious approach here, since I believe that the principles that govern pragmatics are to a large part inherent to this area of grammar and are therefore difficult to map onto syntactic structure and mechanisms. In accordance with Haegeman ("},
{"text": ") and Kocher ("},
{"text": "), I assume that the highest functional head in the left periphery is associated with a traditionally syntactic function, namely that of clausal subordination. The projection is accordingly labeled SubP in the structure in (30). Motivation and discussion can be found in Haegeman ("},
{"text": ") and Kocher ("},
{"text": ")."},
{"text": "While Rizzi placed the original clause typing projection ForceP at the top left edge of the periphery, MoodP is placed in the lower right area of the functional field. I adopt this position because new evidence has shown that clause typing shows reflexes lower in the left periphery. Notably, Haegeman ("},
{"text": "; "},
{"text": ") independently proposed a restructured left periphery, with a projection responsible for clause typing (named ForceP in her proposal) coinciding with the position I assume for MoodP. See Kocher ("},
{"text": ") for further empirical evidence for the precise position of MoodP within the functional field."},
{"text": "Versions of the cartographic approach have been widely adopted to account for word order in Romance languages. It is a particularly useful tool to analyze languages of this family because they exhibit a rich left peripheral structure, providing solid motivation for an extensive functional field like the one in (30). Other languages, however, seem to make do with a less elaborate structure. A conclusion one can draw from these differences is that not all languages project all heads of the functional field. There also appear to be language-internal differences with respect to whether all heads are projected in certain clause types or configurations. Haegeman ("},
{"text": "; "},
{"text": ") notes differences in size between various adverbial clauses. de Cuba & MacDonald ("},
{"text": ") discuss differences in size between factive and non-factive complements. Concerning the languages at the center of the present article, empirical facts suggests that Romance CPs are larger than Germanic CPs (cf. "},
{"text": "). Although the precise size and structure of the German and English CP will not be mapped out here, the contrast between (31) and (32) illustrate that there is in fact a difference in the availability of structural positions. The examples in (31) show that a left dislocated topic is grammatical in a main declarative in all three languages."},
{"text": "The facts are different in embedded contexts: While Spanish and English permit a topic below the complementizer (32-a), (32-c), the same word order is ungrammatical in German (32-b) (but see section 4.4 for a closer look into this issue)."},
{"text": "While the precise architecture of the functional field in each of the languages is left to be determined in future research, these contrasts support the assumption that the German left periphery is more reduced than the Spanish and English one."},
{"text": "It has been observed in the literature that there are parametric differences in the position a verb reaches in German, English and Romance declaratives (cf. "},

{"text": ") and Pollock ("},
{"text": ") and is based on the assumption that the position of the adverbs in the periphery of the VP is fixed cross-linguistically (for a proposal of a universal hierarchy of modifiers see "},
{"text": "). The contrast between (33-a) and (33-b) shows that in English, the finite verb follows the VP adverb and cannot precede it. This has been taken to suggest that the verb remains in V"},
{"text": "."},
{"text": "In Spanish, the opposite pattern emerges. The only grammatical order is the one where the finite verb precedes the VP adverb in (34-b). The reverse order is ungrammatical (34-a). This indicates that the verb moves to T"},
{"text": " in Spanish."},
{"text": "German superficially shows the same pattern as Spanish: The order where the VP adverb precedes the verb in (35-a) is ungrammatical and the order where the VP adverb follows the verb in (35-b) is grammatical. The example in (35-c) illustrates that German is a V2 language. The word order restrictions show that in a declarative the finite verb necessarily occupies the second position of the sentence. It is assumed for German that the finite verbs moves even higher than TP to a position in the CP. In line with Lohnstein ("},
{"text": "), I identify this projection with Mood"},
{"text": "."},
{"text": "The core argument of this section is that the projection hosting the mood feature is occupied by different material in the various sentence moods and languages. The variation we observe is the result of the fact that focus on mood, giving rise to verum, is expressed on different things. This section presents a formalization of the empirical data from Spanish, German and English relying on existing accounts on verbal movement and feature inheritance. The aim is not to develop a new theoretical motivation for verbal movement, rather the more modest goal is to systematize the empirical data and find a formal way to describe them. I am fully aware that further research is pending to motivate certain aspects of the analysis."},
{"text": "There are various options to model head movement and its triggering factors. A comprehensive overview of the main conceptual alternatives and their merits can be found in D\u00e9k\u00e1ny ("},
{"text": "). For the present analyses, I adopt the reprojection approach developed in Biberauer & Roberts ("},
{"text": ") and Roberts ("},
{"text": "). In this account complex heads are externally merged in their inflected forms. Certain formal features on these complex heads require to be checked in a structurally higher position. This provokes movement of the head out of its position and internal merge of it as the sister of the previous phrase. The moved head projects the label of the new syntactic phrase. Biberauer & Roberts ("},
{"text": ") propose that in Romance varieties that have rich tense inflection such as Spanish, the finite verb carries a tense feature that provokes reprojection of a TP. In English, the verb lacks rich tense inflection and its unvalued tense feature cannot project. Head movement from V-to-T does not take place. The tense feature on the verb is valued through "},
{"text": ", which in their accounts is defined as a mechanism that copies feature values from a probe, T in our case, to a c-commanded goal, V, with a matching unvalued feature. Biberauer & Roberts ("},
{"text": ") argue that there is agreement between T and V even in cases when T is filled by an auxiliary. This is based on the data in (36) which show that the verb in V is non-finite."},
{"text": ". We make the following plausible assumption: If a question is unimportant, it follows that each of the answers it contains is also unimportant."},
{"text": " This is why, when the preceding utterance is a declarative, THROW is often felt to be dismissing the proposition that the declarative expresses rather than the issue it addresses. We apply this reasoning to (8) as follows: both in response to (8A"},
{"text": ") and in response to (8A"},
{"text": "), B communicates (via THROW) that it is unimportant "},
{"text": "\u00a0"},
{"text": "\u00a0"},
{"text": ". B thereby implies that it is unimportant "},
{"text": "\u00a0"},
{"text": "\u00a0"},

{"text": "), and that it is unimportant "},
{"text": "\u00a0"},
{"text": "\u00a0"},
{"text": " when responding to (8A"},
{"text": "). The same reasoning applies to all examples in which THROW seems to directly dismiss a proposition."},
{"text": "A question-based approach is corroborated further by the observation that not just any proposition "},
{"text": " that arises in the discourse can be dismissed by THROW in this indirect way. If "},
{"text": " is a declarative, we correctly predict that "},
{"text": " must be the at-issue content of "},
{"text": " rather than, say, implicated or presupposed, since it is the at-issue content of declaratives that is generally taken to answer an implicit question (see, e.g., "},
{"text": "). This restriction is supported by discourses like (10), where A\u2019s utterance plausibly makes salient (at least) the three propositions in "},
{"text": "; we observe that B\u2019s use of THROW can only be understood as dismissing the entailed proposition ("},
{"text": ") by communicating that {"},
{"text": ", \u00ac"},

{"text": " or "},
{"text": ". While this generalization would need to be stipulated under a proposition-targeting account, where "},
{"text": " or "},
{"text": " should also be accessible, it falls out for free on the view that THROW targets the question addressed by a preceding utterance."},
{"text": "Our analysis predicts that THROW should also be acceptable in response to "},
{"text": "In German, a V2 language that also lacks rich tense inflection, the finite verb surfaces in a C-position. Just as in English, German\u2019s poor tense inflection means that V does not carry a tense feature. Reprojection of TP and V-to-T movement do not take place. Instead, according to Biberauer & Roberts ("},
{"text": ") the German verb does not pass through T but moves directly to a C-position. This contrasts with English and Spanish declaratives, where the verb does not reach a C-position. It reprojects T in Spanish, and remains in V in English."},
{"text": "A second central ingredient to analyze the parametric differences in verb positions is Ouali\u2019s system of feature inheritance. He distinguishes between three logical options of how features can be inherited by a head: "},

As I stated at the beginning of this section, as a first step, the goal is to find a formal description relying on existing tools from the theoretical literature. More elaboration and proof should follow in the future."},
{"text": "With this caveat in place, I make the following assumptions: I assume that there is a third important feature involved, namely mood. I also assume that the C-head in Biberauer & Roberts ("},

There are several features that make an analysis in terms of speech acts unattractive. Firstly, while questions are clearly defined semantic objects (sets of propositions) that can be targeted by THROW, a comparable definition for speech acts as targetable semantic objects is missing (see "},
{"text": " for a recent survey of the varied theoretical landscape on speech acts); it is beyond the scope of this paper to provide a complete analysis of what speech acts are, and which semantic objects they deliver to the discourse.

{"text": "If THROW targeted speech acts, we might expect its contribution in (15) to be ambiguous, but this is not the case; B\u2019s use of THROW can only be interpreted as conveying that whether B can pass the salt is unimportant, (15B-i).

One distributional property that has to do with the V2 nature of the language is that the finite verb in German in embedded clauses is not in the second but in the final position. What is interesting for the present discussion is that in embedded sentences, the prosodic stress marking of verum focus does not fall on the sentence final verb, but on the complementizer (63-a) or the relative pronoun (63-b).

Although more comparative research is called for, the pattern we find in the languages I investigated, which are summarized in 3 and 4, could actually be taken to suggest that both mechanisms are necessary: In German, the mood feature is always checked by the verb, suggesting that there are three distinct values. In Spanish, on the contrary, mood morphology is rich. Only in imperatives the feature is checked by the verb. Declaratives and interrogatives have the same structural properties with respect to where the features are checked, and the verbs also have the same mood morphology. This could mean that the mood feature only differentiates two values in Spanish. In English, each clause type has a different structural set up, and the finite verb occupies a different position in each of them. Mood, however, is always checked by the finite verb along with tense. This could mean that the clause type is marked doubly in this language: through the mood feature and the structure."},

{"text": "Despite such concerns, there are strong arguments for treating the different phenomena together, since they share two key similarities. First, the agreements covered are the same, in that they are realized through the same forms (there is no special morphology for the different instances). And second, the different agreement patterns are constrained by the Agreement Hierarchy (\u00a72). Hence what is labelled \u201csemantic agreement\u201d represents a powerful generalization, and the disparities between the phenomena involved only add to its importance. It is natural that, as further constructions are found which follow the constraint, the term \u201csemantic agreement\u201d becomes stretched. A solution is proposed in \u00a73.

Note that the grammar competition theory does not say anything about the way a new generation started having multiple grammars despite their parents\u2019 not having the new grammar as their second option. In order to explain the emergence of a new grammar, the literature has hypothesized that abductive reasoning in language acquisition is the source of language change. Children exposed to language data make an inference about the set of rules that are supposed to generate the language output. However, there is no guarantee that the conclusion that they reach is identical to the rules of the grammar of their parents ("},

{"text": "The grammar competition model and the theory of acquisition-based language change are not in contradiction.

With this in mind, we can reasonably assume that the emergence of new grammar is motivated by children\u2019s looking for a default rule; that is, in pursuit of a default vocabulary insertion rule, children abductively overgeneralized and acquired the rule in (80) via abductive reasoning ("},

{"text": "Lastly, why does the reanalysis cause a genre-sensitive grammar competition, instead of Grammar 2 abruptly replacing Grammar 1? Although this paper does not have a decisive answer, we can imagine a possible scenario: language acquisition starts in a casual register with children surrounded by caretakers, but as they grow up, children become more familiar with more prescriptive situations, for example, by entering school or by being exposed to adult conversations not necessarily directed to them. The social pressure to use the prescriptive grammar of earlier generation forces them to relearn a more restrictive rule, making the vocabulary insertion sensitive to the category, and they may end up using Grammar 1 for formal situations, as well as maintaining Grammar 2 for casual situations; hence, an individual has competing grammars relativized by registers. Thinking this way, we can answer why, in general, a new grammar is found in casual registers, not the other way round. Speakers who do not like casual registers may not accept using Grammar 2, because it sounds cutesy or jokey. Hence, there emerge an inter-speaker variation."},

After Malta was seized by Norman troops coming from Sicily, the islanders were converted to Christianity while keeping their Arabic idiom. Since that time, words to express new ways of life have been borrowed first from Sicilian, then from Italian under the rule of the Knights. After Malta became a British protectorate in 1800, English gradually competed with Italian and eventually superseded it in the school system. In the same time, under the influence of erudite educators, there was a movement toward standardization of Maltese, particularly aimed at promoting education among illiterate people.

Section 2 presents generativist and OT contributions based on the interaction between stress assignment (of Palestinian Arabic type) and vowel syncope; dilemmas which these models have to face are analyzed.

The color of vowels is underlyingly specified or assigned by default in derivations; \u2018reverse ima\u0304la\u2019, which is crucial in Maltese synchronic phonology, is analyzed in this perspective. Section 5 is focused on template-bound verb stems (inherited from Arabic or fully assimilated), and section 6 on freely prepended templatic stems (more recent Maltesized loan-words). The issue of concatenative vs. non-concatenative morphology is briefly addressed. Maltese requires concatenative morphology only. After conversion or freezing of empty positions, main phonological processes are analyzed in section 7: first, stress assignment, correlated vowel length, and vowel quality in word-final position; then, neutralization of voice in a word-final obstruent, and voice agreement in obstruent clusters. The conclusion in section 8 highlights the main outcomes of this paper as a contribution to phonological theory and as overview of Standard Maltese phonology in a unified framework."},

{"text": "A final consequence of what has been observed is that the behaviour of non-implicative object control verbs might be less homogeneous, if their acceptance of non-controlled inflected infinitives depends on (different types of) semantic coercion, as well as other conditions yet to be investigated. This is beyond the scope of the present paper, which focuses on the particular behaviour of the smaller group of implicative object control verbs."},
{"text": "In the present paper, we developed a view of a set of object control verbs as verbs occupying different places in a causative continuum and we linked this to different semantic properties of these verbs and to their behaviour in control structures. The idea that semantics is involved in controller choice is a relevant trend in the literature (see "},
{"text": "; "},
{"text": " for a review). According to the view of object control verbs sketched here, the lexical semantics of the verb must be involved in controller choice: if the object control verb is seen as a causative of the types described here, this must result in a control reading described as object control. This by itself would be a view deviating from the association of controller choice to strict syntactic locality, in the terms defined by the Movement Theory of Control ("},
{"text": "). However, if lexical semantics is also linked to the availability of controlled inflected infinitives, this is also an argument for a larger weight of semantics than the Movement Theory of Control allows. The interpretation of these structures must be explained by a model with a strong syntax-semantics interface, where coercion mechanisms can also be explained, as a result of different conditions, in certain cases also pragmatic conditions."},
{"text": "Finally, a note should be added concerning learnability. How can the fine-grained contrasts defined here between object control verbs be acquired? I would like to suggest that the mapping established between the number of lexically overt arguments which occur in a sentence and the semantic interpretation of the verb might be at the core of (or at least contribute to) an explanation for the acquisition of the semantic structure of these verbs (and consequently for the acquisition of the fine-grained semantic and syntactic restrictions that we have discussed). An important assumption of the syntactic bootstrapping hypothesis is that children are biased to link nouns in sentences to participant-roles in events ("},

{"text": "The analysis of Maltese complex morpho-prosodic alternations has been based on universal principles, in particular OCP, Licensing. Apophonic alternations have been put into perspective with the universal principle of the apophonic path highlighted in some theories. Processes at work are local and attested in all families of languages, for instance right- or left-ward spread, vowel harmony, voice agreement in consonant clusters. The analysis also highlights present consequences of long-term tendencies, such as the weakening of \u2018backness\u2019 in consonants correlated to complex (reverse/counter) ima\u0304la effects in vocalism."},

In particular, we have shown that implicative object control verbs create resilient obligatory control contexts. In the resilient class, obligatory control is maintained even in the case of inflected infinitives and a plural inflected infinitive with a singular controller can be interpreted with a split control reading, but not a partial control reading. As for the non-implicative verbs analysed in the present paper, they belong to the non-resilient class, to the extent that inflected infinitives block obligatory control in their complements and both non-controlled and partial control readings are available; however, more research is probably needed to determine the behaviour of different non--implicative control verbs. To the extent of the argument developed here, the entailment works in one direction: if an object control verb is an implicative, its inflected infinitival complement resists non-controlled readings."},
